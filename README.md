# Playwright Scripts

I am writing some Playwright Scripts to automate some of my browser based workflows.

I can't make all of them public, i will add as much possible.

I used codegen to create a sample test on "https://www.opscribe.site". Do this on your own risk, Opscribe i own myself so there is no worry of consequences. 

```bash
  playwright codegen opscribe.site
```

Thanks
